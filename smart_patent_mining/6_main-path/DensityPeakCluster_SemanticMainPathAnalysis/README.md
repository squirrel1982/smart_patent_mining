# DensityPeakCluster

A cluster framework for 'Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks' in science 2014.  

## How to Use
  
Step0: If your data is not the distance between points but the points' vector, write you distance builder in distance like distance_builder_data_iris_flower.py.  
Step1: Change the data file in step1_choose_center.py, then run it to choose cluster threshold.  
Step2: Change the data file and threshold in step2_cluster.py, then run it.  
```python
python distance_builder_data_iris_flower.py
python step1_choose_center.py
python step2_cluster.py
```

## Dependencies
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org): normal computing
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/): For plotting data to choose threshold
- [Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn): use for mds to plot result (the code work with the version 0.14 and 0.18 are tested.)
